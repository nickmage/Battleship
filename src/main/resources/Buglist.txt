Authorised users must be redirected from "/" or "/#/" to ""#/menu" (http://localhost:8080/#/menu).
Users from http://localhost:8080/#/ are redirected correctly, but redirection from http://localhost:8080/
causes infinite loop, that angular interrupts, so it has no influence on service flow.
Possible solution: set redirect in another place.
